Main Objectives of the GffProject
==========




The principal objectives of the project can be summarised in the following items:

1.  Start learning and using Python as data Analysis Tool.
2.  Create a program using Python (and "special modules like Numpy, SciPy etc."). Program should take .gff file from the directory GFFproject/src/examples/data/*.gff; parse .gff file data; get the genomic sequences (as the example of input data is going to be used Conus_on_aplysia.gff).

Also this program should contain set of options/functions like: 

* Give main information (content from .gff file) about "particular" gene (The name of sequence, The program that generated this feature, the name of this type of feature (exon, cds) etc).
* Construct a chart from the values stored in input .gff file.
* Comparison of protein sequences from gene "gX1" and gene "gX2".
* Calculate gene "gX1" protein sequence length.
